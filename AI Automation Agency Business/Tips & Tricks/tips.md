## AI Automation Agency Playbook

### Business Development & Lead Generation

* **The Phone Warrior: Cold Calling Strategy**

  * Cold calling works. Build a list using Apollo or Lead411. Prioritize companies with \$10M+ revenue. Volume + consistency win.

* **The Executive Clock: Strategic Call Timing**

  * Call when execs are most available: 8:00 AM, before/after lunch, 20 minutes before/after workday ends.

* **Gatekeeper Navigation: The "You Can Help Me" Angle**

  * Use soft positioning with gatekeepers: "You could probably help me..." Turn them into allies for intros.

* **Content Marketing: Share Your Work**

  * Post your builds and wins on Reddit, Twitter, etc. One post can generate millions in pipeline. Don’t worry about copycats.

* **The Power of Follow-Up**

  * Follow-up is where deals are won. Use a CRM. One project took 8–9 calls + 5 weeks of persistence to close.

### Sales & Pitching

* **Lead with a "Wow" Product**

  * Start with a working demo like a voice chatbot. Instant credibility, opens conversations for bigger custom work.

* **Sell Solutions, Not "AI"**

  * Frame around outcomes: fewer missed calls, more jobs booked, cost savings—not LLMs and APIs.

* **The Generalist Opener**

  * Ask how they're using AI today. Listen. Then shape your pitch around their current gaps.

* **Value Proposition Over Price**

  * Emphasize ROI. \$15K automation that saves \$40K/mo is cheap. Anchor value, not features.

### Service Offerings & Pricing

* **The "Foot-in-the-Door" Chatbot**

  * External chatbots as entry point. Price: \~\$5K setup + low monthly retainer.

* **Automation as a Service (AaaS)**

  * Monthly retainer model (\$2.5K+/mo) for continuous automation delivery.

* **Private LLMs for High-Value Clients**

  * For regulated verticals (law, finance, healthcare). Price: \$35K–\$100K+. Ownable, secure, internal.

* **Pricing Your First Project**

  * Discount first deal to build proof and get a killer case study. Next clients will pay more.

* **Factoring in Compute Costs**

  * Be transparent. GPU hosting is real (e.g., \$5K/mo for Llama 4). Price this in or pass cost through.

* **Ongoing Maintenance Retainers**

  * Projects need upkeep. Offer mandatory \$2K–\$4K+/mo retainers for tuning, updates, guardrails.

### Team Building & Operations

* **Partner with Technical Experts**

  * You sell, they build. 30/70 split is common. Don’t need to be an engineer—just have access to one.

* **Recruit Talent from Layoffs**

  * Use blind.com and tech layoff lists to find ex-FAANG builders. Great for credibility and quality.

* **Client Owns the IP**

  * Transparency wins. Don’t lock clients into black-box tools. Build open; let them keep the system.

* **Managing Scope Creep**

  * Always track deliverables. New work = new scope = new price. Be direct, fair, and firm.

# 🧪 Bandit AI Vibe Coding Lab

My working notebook for AI development. Prompt engineering, multi-agent patterns, and practical guides for building with Node.js, n8n, and modern AI tools.

## 🚀 About Bad Tech Bandit

I've never been a traditional developer.

I'm an entrepreneur running two successful businesses. The guy who geeks out over every new tool. Who reads tech news like sports scores. But I always carried this regret—I never studied computer science. 🎓

For years, I'd write a script here, build a small project there. Never enough to build what I imagined. Always just enough to feel what was possible.

Then AI changed the game entirely. 💡

I've been using ChatGPT since GPT-2. Watching this exponential growth has been like watching tomorrow arrive today. And now? With Claude Code automating the tedious parts, O3 Pro reasoning through complex problems, Gemini 2.5 handling multimodal tasks, and Claude Opus 4 orchestrating it all—I'm building real applications. Systems that actually work. Things I dreamed about but couldn't code alone. 🛠️

Here's the wild part: It's June 2025, and fresh computer science grads are struggling to land junior developer positions. That tells you everything about where this is heading. 📈

In a few years, we'll speak applications into existence. The gap between idea and implementation is collapsing faster than most realize. Right now it's clunky—like painting with oven mitts. But it works. And it improves every week.

That's why I'm building this lab. To develop real agency—the capacity to make independent choices and create what I envision, regardless of traditional coding barriers. To think from first principles. To position myself where ideas become reality without gatekeepers. ⚡

This lab is where I share what actually works for me. The prompts I use. The patterns I'm discovering. The weird tricks that turn 8-hour problems into 30-minute solutions.

But here's the thing—this isn't just my journey. I love sharing ideas, and I believe the best discoveries come from collaboration. Whether you're a seasoned developer exploring AI tools or someone like me building without traditional training, your insights matter. Share your prompts. Document your breakthroughs. Let's build this knowledge base together. 🤝

Welcome to the future of building. It's messier than the tutorials suggest, but infinitely more exciting than I imagined.

*Let's build something together.*
